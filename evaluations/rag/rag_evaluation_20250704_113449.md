## Analysis

### What Worked Well

1. Data Retrieval:

   - Adaptive thresholding successfully retrieved more chunks
   - Proper deduplication of similar complaints
   - Better coverage across questions

2. Validation:

   - Successfully detects example copying
   - Enforces response length limits
   - Checks for quoted content

3. Context Selection:
   - More chunks available per question
   - Better relevance distribution
   - Proper handling of duplicates

### Areas for Improvement

1. Model Performance:

   - TinyLlama model is clearly insufficient
   - Responses show lack of understanding
   - Heavy reliance on copying examples

2. Response Quality:

   - Complete failure to follow instructions
   - Excessive repetition
   - No proper use of context

3. Prompt Engineering:
   - Example placement may be problematic
   - Instructions not effectively enforced
   - Format not properly followed

### Recommendations

1. Model Change:

   - Switch to a larger model immediately
   - Consider fine-tuning on financial domain
   - Implement better response filtering

2. Prompt Revision:

   - Remove examples completely
   - Add strict formatting rules
   - Include response template

3. Validation Enhancement:

   - Add repetition detection
   - Implement better semantic checks
   - Add format validation

4. Next Steps:
   - Try GPT-3.5 or similar larger model
   - Implement stricter response filtering
   - Remove examples from prompt
