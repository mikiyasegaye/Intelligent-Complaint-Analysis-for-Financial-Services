Yes, there have been noticeable trends in savings account complaints over time. The most common complaints involve issues with high interest rates, poor communication, and deceptive practices.\n\n2. For example, complaint ID 11561262 states that Capital One's Savings Account has high-yielding interest rates, but there are deceptive practices regarding performance.\n\n3. Another example is complaint ID 2646657, where the complainant mentions that Capital One's Savings Account has been advertising high rates for years, but they split across accounts to stay within FDIC limits.\n\n4. Overall, the data suggests that savings account complaints tend to be more common in the past few years, with issues related to high interest rates, poor communication, and deceptive practices being the most common complaints.\n\n5.
