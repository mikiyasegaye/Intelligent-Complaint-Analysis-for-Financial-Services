## Analysis

### What Worked Well

1. Response Structure:

   - Consistent format with Main Findings and Data Limitations sections
   - Clear citation of complaint IDs when used
   - Professional tone maintained throughout

2. Evidence Utilization:

   - Strong performance in temporal analysis and resolution questions
   - Good integration of complaint IDs and relevance scores
   - Appropriate acknowledgment of data limitations

3. Context Integration:
   - Relevant chunks retrieved for all questions
   - Good balance of specific examples and general trends
   - Proper handling of complaint metadata

### Areas for Improvement

1. Consistency Issues:

   - Some responses use placeholder IDs ("Complaint ID X")
   - Varying levels of detail in evidence utilization
   - Inconsistent use of relevance scores

2. Analysis Depth:

   - Company comparison could be more detailed
   - Product issues lack specific examples
   - Some responses too generic in findings

3. Data Utilization:
   - Retrieved chunks not always fully leveraged
   - Some responses ignore specific details from chunks
   - Generic limitations sections in some responses

### Recommendations

1. Response Enhancement:

   - Eliminate use of placeholder IDs
   - Ensure consistent citation of evidence
   - Deepen comparative analysis where relevant

2. Template Refinement:

   - Add requirement for minimum number of specific examples
   - Include guidance for comparative analysis
   - Standardize relevance score reporting

3. Quality Control:

   - Implement automated check for placeholder text
   - Add validation for complaint ID citations
   - Enforce minimum evidence utilization requirements

4. Next Steps:
   - Focus on consistency in evidence utilization
   - Improve depth of comparative analysis
   - Standardize response detail level
