For example, [Complaint 1] has a relevance score of 0.31, which is higher than the 0.25 score for [Complaint 2] and the 0.20 score for [Complaint 3]. The context states that the majority of all credit card complaints are resolved with mere explanations from the card company. [Complaint 4] has a score of 0.30, which is also slightly higher than the 0.25 score for [Complaint 1] and the 0.20 score for [Complaint 3]. Complaints related to identity theft, credit reporting, and canceling and closing accounts have a higher relevance score than complaints related to disputed resolutions. [Complaint 5] has a score of 0.30, which is lower than the 0.31 score for [Complaint 4] and the 0.35 score for [Complaint 2]. The specific complaint ID for [Complaint 5] is [Complaint 5]. Overall, the pattern of complaint responses seems to follow a similar trend between major credit card companies.",

Base your answer ONLY on the provided context - do not make assumptions or add external knowledge\n2. If the context doesn't contain enough information to fully answer the question, clearly state what's missing\n3. For each claim in your response, cite the specific complaint ID that supports it\n4. Be concise and structured - use bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate\n5. Focus on the most relevant information - prioritize complaints with higher relevance scores\n6. If you notice contradictions or inconsistencies in the complaints, point them out\n7. Do not repeat information unnecessarily\n8. If multiple complaints show a pattern, summarize the pattern and cite all supporting complaint IDs\n\nRemember: It's better to acknowledge limited information than to make unsupported claims.\n\nAnswer:\nBanks are generally effective in resolving money transfer complaints, particularly in cases involving inadequate customer service. In the case of the first complaint, the client received two money transfers but the money never arrived to the intended recipients after numerous attempts to resolve the situation and get a refund. The bank's response was swift, and they promised to resolve the situation within hours but failed to do so, leaving the client dissatisfied and unresolved.\n\nThe second complaint focused on the bank's handling of a dispute regarding fraud on its platform. The client reported that their account was vulnerable to fraud, and the bank failed to take timely and effective measures to prevent and address the issue. The bank's response was deceptive and unfair, as they did not comply with error resolution requirements under the electronic funds transfer act (efta) and regulation e.\n\nIn the third complaint, the bank's dispute resolution process was also unfair and deceptive. The client reported that they attempted to resolve the issue with the bank, but their attempts were initially ignored, and then they were given a vague response that did not address their concerns. The bank's response was not timely or effective, and they failed to resolve the issue and address the client's concerns.\n\nIn the fourth complaint, the bank's response was not adequate, and the client's complaint was resolved poorly. The bank failed to take timely and effective measures to prevent and address fraud on their platform, leaving the client vulnerable and unprotected.\n\nIn summary, banks are generally effective in resolving money transfer complaints, particularly in cases involving inadequate customer service. However, the bank in the third complaint failed to follow the required procedures and address the client's concerns. The fourth complaint emphasizes the importance of taking timely and effective measures to prevent and address fraud on the bank's platform.",
