## Analysis

### What Worked Well

1. Retrieval Mechanism:

   - Successfully finds relevant documents for most queries
   - Maintains context across different complaint types
   - Properly handles temporal aspects in queries

2. Response Format:

   - Consistent structure in responses
   - Includes relevant complaint IDs
   - Maintains professional tone

3. Context Integration:
   - Successfully combines information from multiple complaints
   - Preserves important metadata (dates, products)
   - Handles redacted information appropriately

### Areas for Improvement

1. Relevance Scores:

   - Most retrieved chunks have low relevance scores (0.13-0.45)
   - Some retrieved content is only tangentially related
   - Need better semantic matching

2. Response Quality:

   - Tendency to make unsupported claims
   - Sometimes contradicts provided evidence
   - Responses could be more concise

3. Context Utilization:
   - Not all retrieved chunks are effectively used
   - Some responses ignore important details
   - Better chunk selection needed

### Recommendations

1. Technical Improvements:

   - Fine-tune embedding model for financial domain
   - Implement re-ranking of retrieved chunks
   - Add fact-checking against provided context

2. Prompt Engineering:

   - Add explicit instruction to avoid unsupported claims
   - Include requirement to cite specific complaints
   - Add structure requirements for responses

3. Data Processing:

   - Improve chunk size/overlap for better context
   - Add more domain-specific metadata
   - Implement better deduplication (e.g., for duplicate Cash App complaints)

4. Evaluation Framework:
   - Add automated metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore)
   - Include factual consistency checks
   - Add domain expert review process
