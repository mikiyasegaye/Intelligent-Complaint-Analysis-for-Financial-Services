## Analysis

### What Worked Well

1. Improved Response Structure:

   - Better organization with bullet points and numbered lists
   - Clear citation of complaint IDs
   - Acknowledgment of limited information (Q2)

2. Context Handling:

   - Proper sorting of chunks by relevance
   - Inclusion of relevance scores in responses
   - Recognition of duplicate complaints (Cash App)

3. Fact Checking:
   - Response validation against chunks
   - Stricter temperature when validation fails
   - Better handling of metadata

### Areas for Improvement

1. Response Quality:

   - Still making unsupported claims in some cases
   - Sometimes contradicting evidence
   - Over-emphasis on instruction format vs content

2. Relevance Understanding:

   - Misquoting relevance scores
   - Not effectively using relevance for response weighting
   - Including low-relevance chunks in reasoning

3. Prompt Following:
   - Sometimes ignores "no unsupported claims" instruction
   - Inconsistent citation of complaint IDs
   - Verbose responses despite conciseness instruction

### Recommendations

1. Prompt Engineering:

   - Add explicit examples of good/bad responses
   - Include maximum word count
   - Add requirement to quote relevant text

2. Response Validation:

   - Implement stricter fact-checking
   - Add relevance score validation
   - Check for contradictions

3. Model Configuration:

   - Lower temperature further (0.3 â†’ 0.2)
   - Increase minimum relevance threshold
   - Add response length penalty

4. Data Processing:
   - Improve chunk selection criteria
   - Better handling of duplicate complaints
   - Add more structured metadata
