## Analysis

### What Worked Well

1. Data Retrieval:

   - Adaptive thresholding continues to work well
   - Good relevance scores (0.29-0.45)
   - Proper deduplication

2. Validation:

   - Successfully detects repetition
   - Enforces template sections
   - Checks for unsupported claims

3. Context Selection:
   - Relevant chunks retrieved
   - Good date range coverage
   - Appropriate filtering

### Areas for Improvement

1. Model Performance:

   - TinyLlama still severely underperforming
   - Cannot follow template format
   - Generates repetitive content
   - Makes up quotes

2. Response Quality:

   - Template sections ignored
   - Bullet points misused
   - Claims not properly supported
   - Excessive repetition persists

3. Prompt Engineering:
   - Template may be too complex
   - Instructions not effectively enforced
   - Response structure unclear

### Recommendations

1. Model Change (Critical):

   - Switch to GPT-3.5 or similar immediately
   - TinyLlama is not capable enough
   - Consider fine-tuning if needed

2. Template Simplification:

   - Reduce number of sections
   - Make format more explicit
   - Add example of proper citation

3. Validation Enhancement:

   - Add template format check
   - Improve quote validation
   - Add section completeness check

4. Next Steps:
   - Implement model change first
   - Simplify template
   - Add format validation
   - Test with smaller chunks
