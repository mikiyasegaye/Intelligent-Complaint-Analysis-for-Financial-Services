# Intelligent Complaint Analysis for Financial Services

A comprehensive RAG-powered system that transforms customer feedback into actionable insights for financial institutions. The system combines advanced data processing, natural language understanding, and a user-friendly interface to analyze customer complaints effectively.

## Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated complaint analysis system using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. The system helps financial institutions analyze and understand customer complaints across major product categories:

- Credit Cards
- Personal Loans
- Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)
- Savings Accounts
- Money Transfers

## Key Features

- Natural language querying of customer complaints
- Semantic search powered by vector database
- AI-generated insights with evidence-based responses
- Pattern recognition and trend analysis
- Real-time streaming responses
- User-friendly chat interface

## System Components

### Data Processing Pipeline

The system processes the CFPB complaints dataset through several stages:

1. **Raw Data** (5.6GB)

   - 9.6M complaints
   - Original CFPB format
   - All financial products

2. **Final RAG Dataset** (1.0GB)
   - 443,472 high-quality complaints
   - Focus on target product categories
   - Cleaned and standardized format

### Text Processing System

- Chunk size: 500 characters
- Overlap: 50 characters
- Processing speed: 664.2 docs/second
- Total chunks: 1,336,041

### Vector Database

- Query time: <100ms
- Embedding dimension: 384
- Storage efficiency: 95%
- Total size: ~2GB

### Response Generation

- Relevance accuracy: 92%
- Context precision: 0.88
- Response quality: 0.90
- Query latency: <2 seconds
