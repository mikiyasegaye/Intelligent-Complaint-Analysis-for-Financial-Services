# Interim Report: Financial Complaints Analysis Project

## Tasks 1 & 2 Summary

## Overview

This report covers the completion of Tasks 1 and 2 in the Financial Complaints Analysis project. The project aims to build a RAG-powered chatbot for analyzing customer complaints at CrediTrust Financial.

## Task 1: Data Analysis and Preprocessing

### Data Overview

- Total complaints analyzed: 443,472
- Time period covered: [Date range from data]
- Product categories: Credit Cards, Personal Loans, BNPL, Savings Accounts, Money Transfers

### Preprocessing Steps Completed

1. Text Cleaning

   - Removed special characters and unnecessary spaces
   - Standardized text formatting
   - Handled redacted information (XXXX patterns)

2. Data Standardization

   - Normalized product and company names
   - Standardized date formats
   - Created consistent categories

3. Quality Improvements
   - Removed duplicate entries
   - Handled missing values
   - Validated data integrity

### Outputs Generated

1. Complete cleaned dataset: `data/processed/cleaned_complaints.csv`
2. RAG-optimized dataset: `data/processed/complaints_rag.csv`

## Task 2: Text Processing and Vector Storage

### Text Chunking Implementation

- Used RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
- Chunk size: 500 characters
- Overlap: 50 characters
- Total chunks created: 1,336,041

### Embedding Generation

- Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Hardware acceleration: MPS (Apple Silicon)
- Processing speed: 664.2 documents/second
- Total processing time: ~33.5 minutes

### Vector Store Setup

- Database: ChromaDB
- Storage: Persistent disk storage
- Metadata preserved: complaint_id, product, company, state, date
- Successfully indexed all chunks

### Performance Optimizations

1. Processing

   - Implemented batch processing
   - Added caching mechanism
   - Used hardware acceleration

2. Storage
   - Organized cache in `.cache` directory
   - Implemented efficient metadata storage
   - Set up proper git ignore rules

### Verification Results

- Test queries return relevant results
- Semantic search working as expected
- Metadata correctly preserved
- Distance scores show good relevance

## Next Steps

1. Move notebook code to production modules
2. Add comprehensive unit tests
3. Create API documentation
4. Begin Task 3: RAG core logic implementation

## Current Status

- Task 1: Completed
- Task 2: Completed
- Overall project: On track

## Technical Debt

1. Need to move core logic to source code
2. Add unit tests for chunking and embedding
3. Improve documentation coverage
4. Add performance monitoring
