## Analysis

### What Worked Well

1. Data Retrieval:

   - Adaptive thresholding continues to work
   - Good relevance scores (0.13-0.45)
   - Proper deduplication

2. Validation:

   - Successfully detects format issues
   - Identifies unsupported claims
   - Catches improper citations

3. Context Selection:
   - Relevant chunks retrieved
   - Good date range coverage
   - Appropriate filtering

### Areas for Improvement

1. Model Performance:

   - TinyLlama still cannot handle the task
   - Cannot follow even simplified format
   - Makes up statistics and claims
   - Copies raw context

2. Response Quality:

   - Complete failure to use template
   - No proper citations
   - Responses get truncated
   - Makes unsupported claims

3. Prompt Engineering:
   - Even simplified template too complex
   - Format requirements not followed
   - Citation examples not helpful

### Recommendations

1. Model Change (Critical):

   - TinyLlama is fundamentally inadequate
   - Switch to larger model immediately
   - Consider fine-tuning approach

2. Template Revision:

   - Further simplify format
   - Remove all placeholders
   - Add explicit examples

3. Validation Enhancement:

   - Add truncation detection
   - Improve citation checking
   - Add context copying detection

4. Next Steps:
   - Switch to GPT-3.5 or similar
   - Remove template complexity
   - Add better validation
   - Consider chunking changes
