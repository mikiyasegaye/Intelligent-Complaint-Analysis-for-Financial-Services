## Analysis

### What Worked Well

1. Relevance Filtering:

   - Successfully filtered out low-relevance chunks (<0.3)
   - Reduced noise in retrieved results
   - Properly handled duplicate complaints

2. Response Format:

   - Clear bullet point structure
   - Proper citation format defined
   - Word limit enforcement

3. Validation:
   - Proper handling of quoted text
   - Length checks working
   - ID validation functioning

### Areas for Improvement

1. Model Behavior:

   - Ignores improved prompt format
   - Copies example responses verbatim
   - Makes unsupported claims despite instructions

2. Chunk Selection:

   - Too strict relevance threshold (0.3) filters out valid chunks
   - Some questions left with no context
   - Need better balance between quality and coverage

3. Response Generation:
   - Inconsistent response quality
   - Still making unsupported claims
   - Not properly using available context

### Recommendations

1. Model Configuration:

   - Try different model (TinyLlama may be too small)
   - Adjust temperature further (0.2 â†’ 0.4)
   - Add more explicit stop conditions

2. Chunk Selection:

   - Lower relevance threshold to 0.2
   - Implement sliding threshold if too few chunks
   - Add minimum chunk requirement

3. Prompt Engineering:

   - Move examples after instructions
   - Add explicit "DO NOT COPY EXAMPLES" warning
   - Include negative examples

4. Validation:
   - Add semantic validation of claims
   - Implement cross-chunk fact checking
   - Add response format validation
